the paths are all hard coded, so edit the files if you don't like where I put things..

create the directory /tmp/404
change the ownership to the web server
I copied the dat file there as well, not sure if it's needed still, it was at one point.

it expects things to be in /usr/local/apache/htdocs/zork

It uses MySQL as a backend, so you must create a database with the following tables

CREATE TABLE session
( 
  ID VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
  LastAction DATETIME, 
  LastLocatn TEXT,
  UserID VARCHAR(8),
  LastRead DATETIME,
  PRIMARY KEY(ID)
);

CREATE TABLE users
(
  ID INT(8) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  Name VARCHAR(32),
  password VARCHAR(32),
  email VARCHAR(32),

  logins INT(1),
  admin INT(1),

  PRIMARY KEY(ID)
);
